"""Differential-drive (skid-steer) twist: wheel speeds -> body velocity.

No-slip skid-steer kinematics with friction-dependent turning lumped into two
ICR parameters:

    vx  = R (wL + wR) / 2
    wz  = R (wR - wL) / (2 b alpha)        # alpha >= 1 widens the effective track
    vy  = -x_ICR * wz                      # lateral drift from a longitudinal ICR offset

(alpha, x_ICR) come from the friction field via the moment-centroid map (Phase 4),
or are passed as constants. The rear wheel is kinematically redundant (consistent
when driven at the L/R average) and does not enter the twist.

Conventions: body X fwd, Y left, yaw CCW+. Arrays may carry a leading batch dim.
