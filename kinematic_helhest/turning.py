"""Friction -> turning-parameter map (Phase 4).

The moment-centroid map from per-wheel friction and normal load to the two ICR
parameters used by the twist:

    w_i   = mu_i * N_i                      # lateral grip "weight" at each wheel
    x_ICR = sum_i w_i x_i / sum_i w_i       # rotation center pulled toward grippy wheels
    alpha = 1 + k * sum_i w_i / (g * m)     # more total grip -> wider effective track

For uniform friction on flat ground this reduces to alpha = 1 + k*mu and
x_ICR = CoM_x (rotation about the load centroid). Lowering the rear friction
shrinks sum w -> alpha down -> the robot yaws MORE (the replay_real mu_rear
finding), and pulls x_ICR toward the front axle (rear kicks out).
